        I'm a Graphic and Web Designer and Developer living and working in the Greater Boston Area. I am passionate about front-end development, design, art, diversity, accessibility, and&nbsp;community.

        I joined Epsilon as a Senior UX Front End Developer in October 2018. Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at Vistaprint, where I held leadership roles in the Pride and Women in Technology employee resource groups and was an integral participant in the Inclusion&nbsp;group.

        I’m proud to serve as a City Director for Lesbians Who Tech Boston, and to have moderated the group’s 2017 Out Leadership Panel. I’ve been on the other side of the panel experience, too. I was a panelist on the Lesbians Who Tech Roundtable at Wentworth Institute of Technology in November 2018, the Step up and Be a Leader panel at ACT-W Boston in August 2017, and the Women in Careers Meet and Greet panel at Grafton High School in January&nbsp;2017.

        I received my B.A. in Studio Arts with a concentration in Graphic Design from Salve Regina University in 2010, and I've since completed multiple continuing ed courses. Most recently, I graduated from Thinkful's Full Stack Flex program and completed ThinkB!G.LearnSmart's course on Web Accessibility, WCAG 2.0, and Section 508&nbsp;Compliance.

        I love puppies, sunshine, weird art, and puns. I have a knack for finding typos, I know how to fold a fitted sheet, and I finally figured out how to keep plants&nbsp;alive.

        Friends and colleagues describe me as: passionate, vibrant, a force, a fearless leader, a unicorn, and the most organized person [they've] ever&nbsp;met.

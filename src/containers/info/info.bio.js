			<p className="body">I'm a Graphic and Web Designer and Developer living and working in the Greater Boston Area. I am passionate about front-end development, design, art, diversity, accessibility, and&nbsp;community.</p>
			<p className="body">I have an insatiable appetite for learning. I received my B.A. in Studio Arts with a concentration in Graphic Design from Salve Regina University in 2010, and I've completed several continuing ed courses since. Most recently, I graduated from Thinkful's Full Stack Flex&nbsp;program.</p>
			<p className="body">I am a City Director for Lesbians Who Tech Boston. I hold leadership roles in Vistaprint's Pride and Women In Technology employee resource groups, and I'm an active member of the Inclusion employee resource&nbsp;group.</p>
			<p className="body">In November&nbsp;2017, I moderated Lesbians Who Tech's Out Leadership Panel. I was a panelist on the Step Up and Be a Leader panel at ACT-W Boston in August&nbsp;2017 and the Women in Careers Meet and Greet panel at Grafton High School in January&nbsp;2017.</p>
			<p className="body">I love puppies, sunshine, weird art, and puns. I have a knack for finding typos. I very recently figured out how to keep plants alive, and I'm super excited about it. I know how to fold a fitted&nbsp;sheet.</p>
			<p className="body">Friends and colleagues describe me as: passionate, vibrant, a force, a fearless leader, and the most organized person [they've] ever&nbsp;met.</p>

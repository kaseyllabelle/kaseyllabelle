## Drawings and paintings

As a kid, I'd set up a still life composition – turning random household items into props – and draw for hours on end. When selecting props for my still life compositions in college, I found myself drawn to this one sugar bowl. It was in so many of my drawings that my professor gifted it to me when I graduated. It still has its own shelf in my house. I also found a love for figure drawing. Here are a few of my drawings and paintings.

<p class="subtle">Created with: graphite pencil, conté crayon, charcoal, watercolor, gouache</p>

## Letterpress

These days, I enjoy convincing friends to attend workshops with me so I can try my hand at things like letterpress, stained glass, pottery, and glass blowing. I took a letterpress workshop at Reflex Letterpress and made these note cards for the sake of fuck.

## Bookbinding

I designed, printed, and hand-bound my first portfolio. It was easy to fall in love with the process, the texture of fine paper, the feel of bookcloth, and the way different binding methods can evoke such different feelings. Here are a few samples of books and journals I've bound.

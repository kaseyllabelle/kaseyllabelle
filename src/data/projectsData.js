    description: [
      `One of the reasons I joined Boston Scientific was so that I could improve web accessibility for patients and caregivers. I quickly organized a bi-weekly accessibility sync and established a cross-functional program to develop, scale, and sustain a culture of digital accessibility. I analyzed website data, Disability Equality Index questions, legal research findings, capability maturity models, and roles and responsibilities matrices to inform the program strategy and develop the charter, roadmap, goals, and recommendations for strat plan and AOP.`,
      `I identified opportunities to shift left, and encouraged my team to lead by example. We defined accessibility as one of the foundations of our design system. And we publicly documented our position and approach, along with a wealth of resources to help others on their learning journey. We use automated tooling and conduct user testing with people with disabilities to validate our work, and prioritize stories to address the findings. Our design system accessibility scores exceed industry benchmarks, and our corporate website is improving. Our Lighthouse accessibility scores increased by 20% and our WebAIM Million ranking increased by >501K, landing Boston Scientific in the top 25% and surpassing our competitors.`,
      `Training was, and remains, a crucial step in our path forward and, ultimately, our success. I identified an opportunity to reduce wasteful spend on redundant tooling and repurpose the budget for a pilot training program. I evaluated partners, selected instructor-led trainings, and defined cohorts and role-based learning paths for self-paced online training. Out of 860 invitees, 156 people attended the instructor-led courses. And, while we saw an average score of 97% for self-paced training, only 24% of people who were given licenses completed the training.`,
      `While we are making progress, it's been difficult to achieve some of our larger goals as a grassroots team. Ongoing efforts include: advocating for a company-wide policy and external statement(s), mandatory company-wide training, hiring more people with disabilities and subject matter experts, establishing a capability maturity model, and developing a procurement policy.`

I did some discovery and documented my learnings. I worked with the UX designer and writer on my team to add information about the environmental impact of waste on the web to our design system anti-patterns page. During our next design system office hour, I presented what I learned to our extended community. After my presentation, one of my direct reports expressed interest in sustainability. I encouraged them to do their own discovery, identify opportunities for us to improve our sustainability, and work with our product owner to create and prioritize stories.`,

We added a component to our footer that measures the grams of CO2 per view per page, and compares the page against others tested with the API.

On average, our design system documentation site is 85% cleaner than other pages tested with the Website Carbon Badge API.`,

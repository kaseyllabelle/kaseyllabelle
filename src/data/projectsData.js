Not only are hashtags techy and on-trend, they're also the shape of an intersection, they represent an id/identity, they act as links, they increase awareness and consciousness, and they help to create communities that rally around social movements across the world. Cimpress’ primary typeface, Mark Pro, and Vistaprint’s primary color, blue, served double duty with this logo. Mark Pro's rounded letterforms emit a feeling of warmth and support, and blue is the standard color of a link which further reinforces the connections to tech, links, hashtags, and community. In addition to this logo, I also produced brochures for the group.`

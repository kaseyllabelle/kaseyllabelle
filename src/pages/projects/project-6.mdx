## Overview

Once upon a time, my Drawing I professor told me that I was too much of a perfectionist to be a fine artist and that I should be a graphic designer instead. I enrolled in Graphic Design I and fell in love. (Thanks, GP.)

I have experience designing identity systems, print materials, and digital materials for individual clients, community groups, small businesses, and global companies. I've worked across industries including: beauty and personal care services, banking, broadcast media production and distribution, digital design and marketing, e-commerce, medical technology, mission-driven technology, and real estate.

## Birthday

A punny collection of birthday invitations, thank you cards, return address labels, and milestone posters.

## Women In Technology

Women In Technology is a Cimpress and Vistaprint employee resource group for – you guessed it – women in technology.

When designing the brand, my goals were to convey a spirit of connection and empowerment, with a techy style. I also created a style guide for the WIT brand, flyers, postcards, thank you cards (featuring an intentionally infinite loop), newsletters, signage, swag, and various other event materials.

  <Image src={wit06} class="image" alt="test" />
  <Image src={wit07} class="image" alt="test" />
  <Image src={wit08} class="image" alt="test" />
</div>

## Pride

Pride is a Cimpress and Vistaprint employee resource group for LGBTQ+ employees and allies.

I wanted the brand to convey visibility, community, and a sense of welcoming inclusivity. With that in mind, I started with the rainbow – bright, bold, warm, and historically significant to the LGBTQ+ community. I also created flyers, postcards, newsletters, signage, and other event materials.

<div class="layout-two-up">
  <Image src={pride01} class="image" alt="test" />
  <Image src={pride02} class="image" alt="test" />
  <Image src={pride03} class="image" alt="test" />
  <Image src={pride04} class="image" alt="test" />
</div>

## Lesbians Who Tech

Lesbians Who Tech + Allies is the largest LGBTQ technology community in the world — committed to visibility, intersectionality, and changing the face of technology.

Working within the existing national brand guidelines, I created a sub-brand for the Boston chapter – one of the most active chapters in the country. I designed a logo, business cards for the City Directors, t-shirts and name tags for members, and event flyers. I also designed and developed a website for the Boston chapter.

  <Image src={lwt03} class="image" alt="test" />
  <Image src={lwt04} class="image" alt="test" />
</div>

## JLL

JLL is a global real estate services company with 102,000 employees worldwide and $21.7 billion in annual revenue. Clients range from tech startups to global firms spanning industries including banking, energy, healthcare, law, life sciences, manufacturing, and technology.

I primarily designed logos, brochures, floor plans and maps, websites, signage, and large-format environmental graphics for the leasing and capital markets teams. I also designed corporate ads for newspapers, real estate journals, etc. and corporate reports. The annual Skyline report was a complicated (and expensive) project because it was an offset print job with multiple spot colors and intricate folds. I have fond memories of touching all the papers at Reynolds DeWalt when I went on press.
